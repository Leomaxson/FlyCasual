A good change could be boosting
the 200 points limit into 250.

Then, a warning could be shown to
the player when above 200 points,
but allow the player to proceed.

The limite of 8 ships per squad
shall be kept though.

This would allow players to use
valid squads that became cheaper
until points update releases are 
launched.
